My name is Bernardo Pacheco. I'm a software engineer living and working in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil.

I went to [Federal University of Rio de Janeiro (UFRJ)][1] for a bachelor's degree and a master's degree in Computer Science.

I develop web and mobile applications with technologies including HTML5, CSS, JavaScript, AngularJS, NodeJS and MongoDB. Currently I am involved with any development in the full-stack JavaScript.

I have a great interest in cryptography. It is a fascinating area of beautiful mathematic with a history of amazing people.

I like to share what I know. I appreciate who does the same.
