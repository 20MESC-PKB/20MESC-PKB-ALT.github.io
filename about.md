# About

My name is Bernardo Pacheco. I'm a software engineer living and working in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil.

I’ve gone to [Federal University of Rio de Janeiro (UFRJ)][1] for a bachelor's degree and a master's degree in Computer Science.

I’ve worked on different things already, but currently I am involved with the full-stack JavaScript developing web and mobile applications with technologies including HTML5, CSS, JavaScript, AngularJS, NodeJS and MongoDB.

I have a great interest in cryptography. It is a fascinating area with a beautiful mathematics and with a history of amazing people.

I like to share what I know. I appreciate who does the same.
